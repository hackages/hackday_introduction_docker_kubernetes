### 1) Start and stop containers

In this exercice, we would like to create a container, see it running and then kill it.

For this, you'll need to use the following command

``` bash
docker pull ..
docker run ..
docker stop ..
docker pause ..
docker start ..
docker ps
docker ls
```

You can use the base image of Alpine or CentOS. 

### 2) Inspect logs and data persistence through volumes

Using the command docker logs, try to get some logs from your container.
Then find a way to bind the log folder with a log folder created before on your local machine.

### 3) Port mapping

In this exercice, try to contact an apache container or server by mapping port using the below command.

``` bash
docker run ..
```

### 4) Passing environment variables

Pull the image : docker pull docker.io/josue549/hello-env-ip and find a way to change the ENV variable called MYVAR when running.

Then log on the container and look after the env variable

### 5) Execute commands inside your container

Try to start /bin/sh in your container.
